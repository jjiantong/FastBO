class SageMakerBackend(TrialBackend):
    """
    This backend executes each trial evaluation as a separate SageMaker
    training job, using ``sm_estimator`` as estimator.

    Checkpoints are written to and loaded from S3, using ``checkpoint_s3_uri``
    of the estimator.

    Compared to :class:`LocalBackend`, this backend can run any number of
    jobs in parallel (given sufficient resources), and any instance type can
    be used.

    This backend allows to select the instance type and count for a trial
    evaluation, by passing values in the configuration, using names
    :const:`~syne_tune.constants.ST_INSTANCE_TYPE` and
    :const:`~syne_tune.constants.ST_INSTANCE_COUNT`. If these are given in the
    configuration, they overwrite the default in ``sm_estimator``. This allows
    for tuning instance type and count along with the hyperparameter
    configuration.

    Additional arguments on top of parent class
    :class:`~syne_tune.backend.trial_backend.TrialBackend`:

    :param sm_estimator: SageMaker estimator for trial evaluations.
    :param metrics_names: Names of metrics passed to ``report``, used to plot
        live curve in SageMaker (optional, only used for visualization)
    :param s3_path: S3 base path used for checkpointing. The full path
        also involves the tuner name and the ``trial_id``. The default base
        path is the S3 bucket associated with the SageMaker account
    :param sagemaker_fit_kwargs: Extra arguments that passed to
        :class:`sagemaker.estimator.Framework` when fitting the job, for instance
        :code:`{'train': 's3://my-data-bucket/path/to/my/training/data'}`
